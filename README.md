in this project we try to make our new regression model ecffective by using the steps:
importing the libraries that we will using in all the steps of the program
reading the data that we will work with
analysis ower data to have good information about it 
cleaning data in this step we try to clean our data by deleting the missing value and deleting anomly features that maybe effect in the accuracy of our model
feature extraction we do this step to get more information about adata
feature selection in this step we select the best our the most effective feature in the data
after all this steps
we start to spliting our data into train and testing sets
we select some of Ai Algorithm that is responsible for regression like LinearRegression , SVR , GradientBoosting , RandomForestRegressor
after we make prediction we compare the accuracy of each algorithm and picking the one who has the hights accuracy
